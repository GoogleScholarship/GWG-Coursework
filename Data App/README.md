This is a quick little example app that was created for a student discussion on how front-end fits into data applications.

To students from the GWG Front-End Web Development course:
- You can edit the style using the www/style.css file
- You can edit the chart colors using  www/barChartColors.csv and www/histogramColor.csv.
- If you would like to change the underlying analysis, you will need to edit the ui.R and server.R files. If you want to do this, keep reading.

What you need to make changes to the analysis:
- Download and install <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>.
- Download and install the open source edition of <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop"<R Studio</a>.
- Open the ui and server files in R Studio.
- Check out <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> for tutorials and inspiration.
